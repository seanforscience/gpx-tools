# GPX Tools

This is my toolkit for using the GPX file format.

## Current Offerings

1. Import a GPX file as a GPXFile python object and access relevant track point data as a pandas dataframe.
2. Combine multiple GPX files into a single one.
3. Use Seaborn to plot the multi GPX file tracks as a scatterplot of latitude / longitude.
