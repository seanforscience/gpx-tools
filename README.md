# GPX Tools

This is my toolkit for using the GPX file format.

## Current Offerings

1. Import a GPX file as a GPXFile python object and access relevant track point data as a pandas dataframe.
2. Combine multiple GPX files into a single one.
3. Use Seaborn to plot the multi GPX file tracks as a scatterplot of latitude / longitude.

## TODO

1. I need to update the metadata of the XML file to reflect the fact that it's been recombined.
2. I need to come up with a new "name" tag for the combined XML file.
